Q-Runtime variables
during the runtime you run a task u get the output that output we will be using it somewhere using "register" variable.

if you want to define variable between the task that is possible using "set_fact".

# #https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html
# - name: Demo on Register
#   hosts: all
#   tasks:
#     - name: Print/get uptime
#       ansible.builtin.shell: uptime

#ansible-playbook -i inv -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 02-vars.yml

#it will run the command it will not display the output hence we will use variable

# - name: Demo on Register
#   hosts: all
#   tasks:
#     - name: Print/get uptime
#       ansible.builtin.shell: uptime
#       register: SHELL_OUTPUT

#     - name: print output
#       ansible.builtin.shell:
#       msg: "{{ SHELL_OUTPUT }}"
