Q- facts?
these are predefined variables

Q-Runtime variables
during the runtime you run a task u get the output that output we will be using it somewhere using "register" variable we will print on screen

if you want to define variable between the task that is possible using "set_fact".

# #https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html
# - name: Demo on Register
#   hosts: all
#   tasks:
#     - name: Print/get uptime
#       ansible.builtin.shell: uptime

#ansible-playbook -i inv -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 02-vars.yml

#it will run the command it will not display the output hence we will use variable

# - name: Demo on Register
#   hosts: all
#   tasks:
#     - name: Print/get uptime
#       ansible.builtin.shell: uptime
#       register: SHELL_OUTPUT

#     - name: print output
#       ansible.builtin.debug:
#         msg: "{{ SHELL_OUTPUT }}"

    #   - name: print output
    #     ansible.builtin.debug:
    #       msg: "{{SHELL_OUTPUT.stdout}}"
    #   - name: print output
    #     ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    #       UPTIME: "{{SHELL_OUTPUT.stdout}}"

Q-conditions

- name: Demo on conditions
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run if it is redhat family
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Hello Redhat
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Run if it is debain family
