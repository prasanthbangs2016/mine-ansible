inventory :  Ansible inventory files and organize servers into groups and subgroups
==========
we can keep either ip address or hostname

group can be done either individual file based or environment or based on component and even together and that always depends
upon the architecture design that projecthad.

in environments like a cloud where the nodes are too dynamic and where your ip addresses always change frequently,we need to
work on some dynamic inventory management.
